Code highlighting artefact block for Mahara
===========================================

This is my first (ever) experience of developing atop Mahara, written during a
hackathon at the Mahara UK 2012 conference. It adds a new block to Mahara's
portfolio editor that can highlight the code contained within an uploaded file
artefact.

administration.

Adding support for other languages

Out of the box, support is provided for a few commonly used languages. If you
wish to add more, you can download a customised copy of ``highlight.js`` and
replace the one we ship.
